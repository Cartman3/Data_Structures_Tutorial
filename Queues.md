# Queues

## Introduction


You’re at your favorite amusement park, Disneyland, and you want to get on the rides as fast as you can. 
You narrow down the search criteria to one thing, which line is the shortest and you hop the long lines will get shorter after. 
You are utilizing the idea of a queue to help you achieve your goal!

# How queues work

Queues are pretty straight forward and we use them all the time. 
A queue is referred to as First In First Out (FIFO) or a different way of saying it is Last In Last Out (LILO). 
This means that the first person in line is going to be the first one out like a grocery store line or my example above, a line at Disneyland. 
A queue has a lot of uses and functionality in programming.

To represent the idea further another example of this is if you’re driving a car and come to a stop sign. 
You are in a line and (if everyone is a good driver you) the order of drivers will stay the same until each person goes 
through the intersection where the stop sign is.

For the examples, we will stick to the original idea of the line at Disneyland. 
The lines work exactly like the car example. There’s even an invisible stop sign when you have to wait for the 
next rollercoaster car to pick up the next people.
