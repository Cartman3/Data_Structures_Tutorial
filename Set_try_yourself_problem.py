    # Problem 1 #
###################

# You can mess with this to get familiar with add and remove functions
# Add colors to primary color set and non primary color set.
# The add function also takes in strings you'll need to make multiple statements or use ,

print()

# Code goes here

print(primary_colors) # prints the colors in the set
print(nonpri_colors)  # prints the colors in the set
pass


####################
# Try using duplicates!
# Using the len() you can see how many are in each set
# You can also try removing the elements

###################
    # Problem 2 #
###################

# This problem will be working with the intersection fuction
###### Make sure to add the same color to each set like white to both sets #####


print()
print('----------Problem 2----------')
print()

# Code goes here
# Make sure to add White and Black to each set

print(primary_colors) # prints the colors in the set
print(nonpri_colors)  # prints the colors in the set

print(intersection_of_sets(primary_colors, nonpri_colors)) # 'White, Black'
