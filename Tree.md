# Tree

## Introduction

We've now come to trees, yes I said tree's. I know youre thinking of a tree outside in your yard. You wouldn't be worng for thinking that because that is a great way to think about trees in programming. Trees in programming are like linked lists (I know we didnt go over linked lists in this tutorial). A quick explination, a linked list is a list that is linked with the value in front of it and behind it. Wild right! So the value right next to a specfic one knows whats happening to it. Its like holding hands. If youre holding hands with someone and that person starts walking away, well you'll know they're walking away because you are holding hands or "connected". In other words they have nodes that are connected to the front and back nodes or values.
Trees act the same except they can have multiple nodes that branch off to other nodes. In this way you can actually think of it like a tree. Trees start as one stump and as they grow they grow branches and those branches grow branches and so on. They all can be lead back to the same stump. This is excatly what a tree in programming is.
