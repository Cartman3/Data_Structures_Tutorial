# Set

## Introduction

Let’s say you own a valet business and have 100’s of employees. You’re entering in driver’s license numbers of all your employees into a big spread sheet 
but you don’t want duplicates. An accident happens and you mix up all the drivers licenses. Now you don’t know which ones you entered and which ones you 
didn’t. This is where a set would come in real handy. It will still be a pain but the set will only keep one of each unique number.

## How does a set work?

A set has two important characteristics to them. One, the order is not important. Two, a set does not allow for duplicates.
